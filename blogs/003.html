     <h1 class="f4-ns measure georgia">1. Spike Quickly</h1>
     <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
        Initially, there is not a huge amount of value to raising concerns without concrete backing. Immediately spiking the project
       is incredibly important for getting all parties on the same page.
     </p>
     <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
         If it turns out you are correct and the project will not be a successful product, you now have a "physical" reference to vocalize
         your concerns against. Importantly, this is also a chance to build the product in a successful way as well and vocalizing concerns
         should be framed as a pivot rather than a death sentence (there is no value in a dead project).
     </p>
   <h1 class="f4-ns measure georgia">2. Advocate for Positive Changes</h1>
   <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
      Advocate for positive changes and outline solutions instead of problems - outlining issues simply
      creates more work for others while solving problems leads to a better product.
   </p>
   <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
      To reiterate above, there is no value in a dead project and little point of pushing back without concrete answers
      about what you would do differently. This also creates opportunity in that by advocating for positive changes
      you inherently take on more responsibility. It is also worth considering whether you are able to take on that
      responsibility when advocating for changes.
   </p>
   <h1 class="f4-ns measure georgia">3. Embrace Uncertainty</h1>
   <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
      Embrace the fact that you could be incorrect and do not assume your initial assumptions are perfect.
      There is a very reasonable chance you do not have the full picture and are missing something: being transparent
      and open to change will create goodwill that extends both ways.
   </p>
   <h1 class="f4-ns measure georgia">4. Utilize Sponsors</h1>
    <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
       Utilize sponsors, mentors, and managers to circulate ideas at a reasonable scale before making a public case.
       This allows coalition building and doesn't catch anyone by surprise. In conjunction with "Embrace Uncertainty",
       circulating ideas within small group allows for honest feedback about both the "Spiking Quickly" and project
       as a whole.
    </p>
    <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
       Note: I am not advocating for unneeded politicking rather trying to make the case for keeping the people you
       work the most with fully in the loop.
    </p>
    <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
       Surprises are generally a sign that something has not gone well with utilizing sponsors. Timing is everything and picking
       the right time to push back is critical.
    </p>
   <h1 class="f4-ns measure georgia">5. Create Social Capital</h1>
   <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
     Pushing back is easy in some cases and harder in others. It is super dependent on team, role, culture, and a whole
     bunch of other social factors. It is entirely possible to make the correct case and still fail at convincing people.
     Working within the system or working to change the system may be necessary in order to generate enthusiasm for your
     newly proposed solutions.
   </p>
   <h1 class="f4-ns measure georgia">6. Hope</h1>
   <p class="f4-ns measure georgia">
     Getting stuck with bad projects is an incredibly common problem as a software engineer. Finding
     your way out is possible - it just takes a little planning, positive attitude, and working in a constructive way.
